Introduction

This document outlines the steps to create an AI-driven web application for IoT insights, leveraging pre-trained AI models available through GitHub APIs. The application will simulate IoT data, integrate AI for predictive insights and anomaly detection, and display actionable data in real time using ASP.NET and Razor Pages.

Project Concept
Goal: Build a web app that processes simulated IoT data and uses GitHub-hosted AI models for analytics.  
Use Case Example: Environmental monitoring (e.g., air quality, temperature trends, or energy consumption).  
Key Features:
- Simulated IoT data streams.
- AI-powered analytics using GitHub APIs (DeepSeek-R1, ChatGPT-4o Mini, Meta-Llama).
- User-friendly dashboard for data visualization and alerts.

Technology Stack
1. Backend:
   - ASP.NET for web app development.
   - Razor Pages for server-side rendering and dynamic content.
   - REST API integration for GitHub Model APIs.
   - Database: SQLite or Azure Cosmos DB for storing simulated data.

2. Frontend:
   - Razor Pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Chart.js or Highcharts for interactive visualizations.

3. AI Integration:
   - GitHub APIs for AI models:
     - DeepSeek-R1 for reasoning and anomaly detection.
     - ChatGPT-4o Mini for conversational analytics.
     - Meta-Llama for advanced NLP tasks and predictive insights.

4. Data Simulation:
   - Python (NumPy/Pandas) or C# scripts to generate realistic IoT data streams.

5. Cloud Services:
   - Azure Free Tier or Google Colab for hosting AI API connections.

Development Workflow
1. Setup the Environment:
   - Install Visual Studio and set up an ASP.NET project using Razor Pages.
   - Register for GitHub Model API keys for the models you want to use.
   - Install libraries for data visualization (e.g., Chart.js).

2. Simulate IoT Data:
   - Write scripts to generate realistic sensor data:
     - Temperature: Random values within 15°C to 35°C.
     - Air quality metrics or energy consumption.

3. Integrate GitHub Model APIs:
   - Use HTTP client libraries in ASP.NET backend to query GitHub-hosted models.
   - Process IoT data using:
     - DeepSeek-R1 for detailed reasoning and anomaly detection.
     - ChatGPT-4o Mini for conversational insights and pattern recognition.
     - Meta-Llama 3 for enhanced predictions and analytics.

4. Design Razor Pages:
   - Create pages for:
     - Dashboard: Visualize sensor trends and AI insights using graphs/charts.
     - Alerts: Display warnings or detected anomalies.

5. Database Integration:
   - Use SQLite for storing simulated data.
   - Set up data models to fetch and display real-time sensor data.

6. Frontend Enhancements:
   - Implement interactive graphs using Chart.js or Highcharts.
   - Style with CSS for a clean and engaging interface.

7. Testing & Deployment:
   - Test the web app functionality and AI predictions.
   - Host on a local server or a cloud platform (Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud).

Final Deliverables
1. Functional web app showcasing:
   - IoT data visualization.
   - AI-powered insights using GitHub Model APIs.
2. A live demo highlighting:
   - Real-time updates.
   - Scalable architecture for future expansion.
